PROJECT TITLE: KivaWorld 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Simulation of a robot traversing a floor of obstacles, picking up objects, and dropping them in the propper zone.
VERSION or DATE: 2021
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: This can be ran using BlueJ from Duke University located here: https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/downloads/bluej.php?course=2
1. Create a new RemoteControl the run it. 
2. Select a sample_floor_map then pay careful attention to the output listed and enter your commands.

AUTHORS: Jeffrey VanMeter
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Once running it automatically starts the simulation, use the following commands to make the robot move F, L, R, T, D. Each of these translates to Forward, Left, Right, Take, and Drop. Enter all commands to be taken before hitting enter. 

**This project is incomplete. It's missing error handling which would allow the user to make multiple attempts at getting the right combination of commands. It could also be improved to allow the user to enter one command at a time and visually move the robot in the corresponding direction
