Conflict resolution summary:

The merge conflict was resolved by opening the README.md file in the vi
editor. I made both files contain the same information then saved
the changes. After that I added and committed the changes to the repository.
This resolved the conflict and allowed the change to take place.


Changes from part C:

In services.html I fixed the paragraph tag under the Fully Responsive header
to make the text appear properly on the webpage.
In team.html I changed the text to purple for Marsha.
In vision I added strong and em to mission statement.
