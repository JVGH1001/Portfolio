There are some other good project not listed here, click around and take a peek.

These were made during my highschool years
rps - rock, paper, scissors with hidden twist/cheat. Hint - it's in the bottom right corner and very small, just click around the area and you should find it.

ranco - Something I made when bored. Clicking the button will make random pixels turn a random color. You can click the button multiple times or just once then hold enter for even better experience. It also goes full screen when maximized.
